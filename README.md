# Scenarios for Nutanix X-Ray
Scenarios are the core of Nutanix X-Ray. They enable a reproducable sequence of events that make up a test against a virtualized system. Scenarios are implemented using YAML to describe the events and leverage additional files, such as those from fio, to execute workloads.
